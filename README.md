# MotaWord MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The **MotaWord MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a private interface that provides structured, real-time access to translation project data. It‚Äôs designed to offer external systems (like LLMs, automation tools, or admin dashboards) context-aware visibility into the status, structure, and progress of ongoing translation jobs on the MotaWord platform.

This protocol enables seamless monitoring of translation workflows, allowing authorized systems or users to retrieve current project states‚Äîtranslation, review, or completion‚Äîwithout relying on manual updates or emails.
